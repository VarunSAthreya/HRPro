We look forward to helping you achieve success and prosperity.\n\nAbout Us\nOur Mission\nTo make Contentstack indispensable for organizations to tell their stories and to connect with the people they care about through inspiring modern experiences. \nOur Vision \nOur vision is to pursue equity and use technology to break down barriers and enable people to unlock their highest potential. \nOur Values\nWe are more than colleagues, we are a tribe\nWe care deeply about our customers and the communities we serve\nWe are dreamers and dream makers who challenge the status quo\nWe do the right thing even when no one is watching.\nWe are curious trendspotters and brave trendsetters.\nWe are global - diverse, yet close; distributed yet connected.\n\nAt-Will Employment\nEmployment with the Contentstack is voluntarily entered into and the employee is free to resign at any time, with or without cause. Similarly, the Contentstack may terminate the employment relationship at will, at any time, with or without cause. More detailed information is mentioned in your employment letter.\n\nPolicies outlined in this handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between the Contentstack and any of its employees for any specific duration. The provisions of the handbook have been developed at the discretion of management and may be amended or canceled at any time at the Contentstack’s sole discretion. The only exception to any changes is our employment-at-will policy permitting you or the Contentstack to end our relationship for any reason at any time, with or without cause.  \n\nExcept in work locations or countries that do not require a specified Employment Contract relationship, or unless specifically set forth otherwise in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of the Contentstack; all employment with the Contentstack is at-will. Either the employee or the Contentstack may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause. These “at-will” provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may not be amended or added to without the express written approval of the Chief Executive Officer.
In full-time employment with the Company, while in the employment of the Company, you are not allowed to be employed in any other organization on a permanent, temporary or part time basis nor shall you offer your services with or without consideration to any physical person, legal entity or public authority or be occupied in your own business, without the prior written consent of the Company. You will comply with all directions given to you by the Company and faithfully observe all the rules, regulations, and arrangements applicable to you.\n\nEmployee and Contractor Privacy Notice \nAs controllers of your personal data, we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal data about you. We are required under applicable Data Protection Laws to notify you of the information.\nPersonal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). \nThis is the data that we collect. We only use personal data when the law allows us to do so. Most commonly we will use personal data to send communications, calculate pay, pension, and attendance monitoring, as well as other fundamentals.\n\nInternal Communications Guidelines \nAt Contentstack, we place value on staying connected, even though we are diverse and distributed, and we do the right thing, even when no one is watching. These principles guide how we communicate with each other, allowing kindness, tact, and discretion to be the hallmark in all our interactions. The purpose of this guideline is to allow our employees and business to run as effectively as possible while honoring our Contentstack’s mission, vision, and values.\nWhen interacting with each other we will follow these guidelines:\nKindness, information sharing, and the spirit of teamwork ground our communication with each other.\nWe will not always agree, but we will handle disagreements respectfully and professionally, avoiding gossip and office politics.\nConstructive feedback is welcome, particularly when it helps us or our business grow and improve. It should be delivered professionally and with tact, understanding that often these conversations are best-done one-on-one. \nWe have a very strict no a$$hole policy. This means disparaging remarks about religion, ethnicity, sexual preference, appearance, and other non-work related matters are quite frankly not tolerated. Inappropriate remarks may include those that assign a behavior disparagingly, imply the inferiority of a group, are supposedly funny at someone else’s expense, and/or cause embarrassment or discomfort to others based on these comments. If you are found to have engaged in any of these activities at work, or while representing Contentstack, it is grounds for immediate termination.\nIf You See Something, Say Something. As a tribe, we all share responsibility for maintaining our culture and observing our values. If you witness a situation that doesn’t meet the high bar outlined above, please do something. Talk to the people involved if you feel comfortable, talk to your manager, or reach out to the People team. Just don’t ignore it! By continuing to support, educate, and remind each other – and holding ourselves accountable – we keep Contentstack safe, fun, kind, and rewarding for everyone.\nContentstack primarily relies on these channels for communication:\nGmail \nWhen you need to include someone outside the Contentstack\nLonger communications with lots of details\nTopics are more sensitive or require a higher level of confidentiality\nSlack \nWhen you need a quick/easy answer\nNeed an immediate response\nWant to collaborate in real-time\nWant to connect casually\nZoom Conferences \nTeam or group meetings\nFace-to-face conversations \nTo iterate on complex topics or conduct training\nWhen verbal communication is preferred\nAt Contentstack, we have several Slack Channels to facilitate business, team, and topical conversations. Channels preceded with a lock are closed and by invitation only. Channels preceded with a hashtag are general channels and are open to all employees.
"Use this guide to determine which channel is best suited for your topic.\n\n#global\t\t\tFor Contentstack-wide business topics only. Used to share essential business information and important announcements.\n\n#random\t\t\tFor generally useful information to be shared with our entire team but more casual than #global.\n\n#contentstack-india\tFor India-wide business topics, any important updates and announcements.\n\n#watercooler\t\t\tFor casual, non-business related region-specific topics specifically targeting our US/EMEA teams. Think of this as casual conversations you’d have over coffee.\n\n#contentstack-celebrates \tJoin this channel to celebrate birthdays, new hires (welcoming them), anniversaries, and any other personal celebrations ex: babies, weddings, new homes, etc. \n\n#cs-cares\t\t\tJoin this channel to get updates on how we as a tribe are contributing to the community.\n\nIn order to keep the #global channel clutter-free and avoid people missing important announcements, it’s key to manage the volume of messages. If you’re not sure whether you should post something to #global it’s probably a better fit for #random or #watercooler.\n\nGeneral Conduct Standards  \nHarassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation Prevention and Investigation\nNote: This Policy is supplemental to other related guides provided to and acknowledged by you during your onboarding process. Should you have any questions regarding the interplay between the policies, please reach out to your manager or the People Team for clarification. We’re here to help.\nOur Policy\nContentstack prides itself on being an inclusive workplace where everyone can feel safe, comfortable, respected, positive, and productive; a place we feel empowered to bring our best, most authentic selves to work.  \nTo reinforce this culture, Contentstack prohibits harassment and discrimination based on, or because of, any personal characteristic that is protected by law or outlined below. Additionally, any behavior that creates an environment where employees feel marginalized or disrespected is not allowed.\nWe also prohibit retaliation for reporting discrimination or harassment based on these categories, or for making a complaint and/or participating in an investigation to resolve a harassment or discrimination complaint. \nThis policy protects from harassment or discrimination in employment because of, but not limited to:\nAge \nColor\nDisability (physical or mental)\nGender, Gender Identity, and Gender Expression\nMarital Status\nMedical Condition (genetic characteristics, cancer, or a record or history of cancer)\nReligion/Religious Creed or Caste (including religious dress and grooming practices)\nSex/Gender (includes pregnancy, childbirth, and conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth)\nSexual Orientation\nAll employees, interns, contractors, visitors, and vendors including all involved in the operation of our business or those authorized to be in our workplace or interact with our employees are covered by this policy.\nBehaviors covered and prohibited include but are not limited to\nVerbal comments, derogatory or demeaning jokes, slurs, or unwanted sexual advances - verbal or physical.\nPhysical conduct, such as physically threatening another person, making physical contact in an unwelcome manner,  or blocking or impeding or other physical interference with normal work or movement.\nVisual displays including but not is limited to symbols, cartoons, drawings, emails, or other communications that are derogatory and/or sexually oriented.\nThreats, implications, or demands to submit to sexual requests as a condition of employment or favorable employment outcomes.\nRetaliation for reporting, expressing concern, or indicating the intention to report any type of harassment.\nFor the purpose of this policy, in relation to our work environment, free speech is subject to our responsibility and legal obligation to create an inclusive workplace free from harassment or discrimination. This means, that while we respect our employees’ right to free speech if it creates a hostile or harassing environment in the workplace, it is not allowed.
"Every employee, regardless of role, location, or position, is legally responsible for their own actions. This means, that should you violate this policy, not only will you be subject to disciplinary action from Contentstack, up to and including termination, but you can also personally be held legally liable.\nManagers who observe or have knowledge of conduct they believe could potentially be harassing, discriminatory, or retaliatory have a mandatory duty to report the conduct or situation to the People Team or Senior Leadership.\n\nFiling A Complaint\nIf you have experienced or witnessed unlawful harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or simply behavior that is not consistent with Contenstack’s values, please report it to a manager or the People Team so we may remedy the situation as appropriate. \nAs much as possible, you will be asked to provide details, dates, and names of those involved, and of any witnesses.\nManagers who are made aware of conduct they believe could potentially be harassing have a mandatory duty to report the conduct or situation to the People Team or Senior Leadership.\nHow We Investigate\nWhen we receive knowledge of a possible violation of this policy, Contentstack will begin a fair, objective, and good-faith investigation of the allegations. Depending on the circumstances, the investigation may be conducted internally or an external investigator may be brought in to consult. Every effort will be made to keep the details of the investigation confidential; however, we cannot guarantee this as it may be necessary to reveal some details in order to conduct a thorough investigation.\nAll investigations conducted or authorized by Contentstack will be objective and in good faith based on witness interviews and workplace evidence, providing a fair process for all relevant parties.\nInvestigations will be conducted timely, their progress documented, and where appropriate the outcomes communicated to the complainant and other relevant parties.\nCorrective Actions and Responses\nIn any event that an investigation reveals a violation of this policy has occurred, corrective and preventive action will be taken proportionate to the nature and severity of the offense. Those determined to be in violation may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Managers or Leaders being aware of such behaviors and not reporting them are also subject to similar disciplinary action.\nNo Retaliation\nContentstack adheres to a stringent anti-retaliation policy for any reporting of a suspected or actual violation of this policy. Employees or Managers found to have engaged in retaliatory behavior are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\nUse of Company Equipment, Data Security, and Compliance\nAll data stored, accessed, or created on work computers provided by Contentstack is considered the property of Contentstack. This includes but is not limited to documents, emails, software, and any other digital assets.\nUsage Guidelines\nEmployees are expected to use work computers for work-related purposes only.\nPersonal use of work computers should be limited and in compliance with company policies.\nUnauthorized installation of software, downloading of unauthorized content, or engaging in activities that pose security risks to the company\u0027s network is strictly prohibited.\nMonitoring\nContentstack reserves the right to monitor and review all data stored, accessed, or transmitted through work computers to ensure compliance with company policies and legal regulations.\nConfidentiality\nEmployees are required to maintain
the confidentiality of any proprietary or sensitive information stored or accessed on work computers, in accordance with the company\u0027s confidentiality policies.\nData Security\nEmployees are responsible for safeguarding data stored on their work computers by following best practices for data security, including password protection, encryption, and regular data backups.\nCompliance\nViolation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and legal action as deemed necessary by Contentstack.
"Acknowledgment\nBy using a work computer provided by Contentstack, employees acknowledge and agree to comply with the terms outlined in this policy.\nCode of Business Ethics and Conduct\nAt Contentstack, we do the right thing, even when no one is watching. Our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct indicates that employees conduct themselves with the highest standards of business ethics and to avoid any appearance of wrongdoing while observing all applicable laws and regulations in the course of conducting business or representing Contentstack.\nWe expect our employees to follow the spirit and the letter of this code, and if needed, cooperate with any inquiries or investigations concerning a possible or suspected violation of this Code, unless you are informed at the time of the investigation that your participation is voluntary. Any employee’s failure to fulfill their responsibilities under this Code may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment.\nWe further strongly encourage the use of “threaded conversations”. Instead of posting to the channel, reply to a specific message to connect it for better context and to minimize message flooding.\nEthical Standards\nContentstack is committed to conducting business in a fair and open manner within the spirit and letter of the law, with the highest regard for customers, the community, and our employees. \nOur success depends not only on the knowledge, skills, and abilities of our employees, but also on their performance of work with sound judgment, self-discipline, common sense, and integrity. As such, all worksite employees are required to maintain and uphold the following common ethical standards, in all aspects of their work:\nPerform their work in a manner that does not conflict with the integrity of the Contentstack or the public interest;\nBe truthful and accurate in performing job functions;\nProtect Confidential Information as defined in this handbook;\nObserve all laws, regulations, ordinances, and rules applicable to the operation of the business;\nMaintain honest and fair relationships with all Contentstack vendors;\nEnsure quality and value in Contentstack’s products/services and relationships with customers and vendors; and\nAvoid any situations that may engender any conflict between the personal interests of employees and the exercise of discretionary decisions on behalf of the Contentstack.\nConflicts of Interest\nContentstack wants your full attention focused on your job with us.  So, employees must not engage in any conduct and must avoid situations that would create an actual or potential conflict of interest in performing their job or create the appearance of such a conflict.\nConflicts of interest arise in work situations when an employee’s personal activity or personal interest is contrary to the interests of the Contentstack. These personal activities or interests may influence the employee’s judgment, causing them to make decisions on behalf of the Contentstack based upon the potential for personal gain, rather than in the best interests of Contentstack.\nTo prevent conflicts of interest, the following behaviors are unacceptable and unethical, except where the law provides otherwise:\nReceiving or giving of merchandise, money, favors, services, travel, accommodations, lavish entertainment, or other benefits that might appear to have been given to influence a business decision. Gifts offered or received at any time in your capacity as an employee or someone representing Contentstack with a value between $26 and $100 require approval by your manager. Gifts of significant value over $100 require an appropriate written explanation to the People Team and cc: your Department Head for an exception. \nMaintaining a personal, business, or financial relationship with a potential or actual customer or vendor where the employee has control or influence over the Contentstack’s relationship with that customer or vendor. \nUsing information developed or learned on the job for personal or familial benefit. This includes the use of Contentstack databases, financial information, and intellectual property.
"Maintaining outside directorship, employment, or political office that might appear to or conflict or compete with an employee\u0027s responsibilities.\nConducting Contentstack business with, or using position or authority to influence the Contentstack to conduct business with, family members.\nUnauthorized sharing of Confidential Information, (as defined in our training), or proprietary Contentstack-related information with business associates or representatives of other companies.\nThe list above serves only to illustrate sources of possible conflicts of interest and does not constitute a complete list of all the situations that may result in a conflict of interest. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of each worksite employee to avoid any situation that could affect their ability to judge situations independently and objectively on behalf of the Contentstack and any situation that could even appear to be a conflict of interest. It is important to note that under certain circumstances, conflicts of interest can amount to violations of criminal law. Any doubts should be resolved in a discussion with your manager or the People Team.\nEmployment of Relatives and Significant Others\nTo avoid conflicts of interest and to promote stability and goodwill in the workplace, we usually don’t hire or transfer relatives into positions in which they supervise or are supervised by another close family member. We also try to avoid placing them in positions in which they work or have access to sensitive information about family members. The same general considerations apply if two employees marry or become involved in a domestic partner relationship. If a supervisory, security, morale, safety, or other conflict results from the relationship, we reserve the right to use our discretion in hiring and placing worksite employees in a manner designed to avoid these concerns. One of the worksite employees may be transferred— or, if necessary, terminated—to resolve the situation.\nThe term “relatives,” as used in the preceding paragraph, refers to a spouse or domestic partner, parents, legal guardians, siblings, children, grandparents, grandchildren, or current in-laws. (Natural, step- or adopted relationships are included in this definition.) This Code also applies to significant others. In addition, if a conflict or appearance of a conflict arises because of a dating relationship, at our sole discretion, the conflict may be resolved by transfer of one or both worksite employees or termination of employment. There may be other considerations or restrictions based on job requirements and situations specific to your Contentstack. Check with the People Team for clarification. If a relationship forms in an organization\u0027s reporting structure, please notify your manager and the People Team so they can help discuss possible solutions.\nRecognizing \u0026 Reporting a Conflict\nIt is essential that all employees pay close attention to possible violations of the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, whether they occur because of an oversight or intention. Any worksite employee who is aware of possible violations should notify his or her manager, a Senior Leader, or the People Team. If you are not sure whether there is an ethical problem, it is better to ask.\nHere are some signs to watch for:\nYou feel uncomfortable about a business decision, or about something you’ve been asked to do at work.\nYou have witnessed a situation involving a business decision that made you or someone else feel uncomfortable.\nYou feel that the Contentstack would be embarrassed, or face legal implications if a business conflict were revealed to the public.\nViolation of the Code\nViolations of this Code will be grounds for termination or other disciplinary action, according to the circumstances of the particular violation. Disciplinary action will be taken against individuals who authorize or participate directly in a violation of the Code. Disciplinary action also may be taken against any of the violator\u0027s managerial superiors, to the extent that the circumstances of the violation reflect inadequate supervision and leadership by the superior.
"Compliance with the Code will be considered in the evaluation of each individual’s overall performance.\nProhibition Against Retaliation\nIf an employee or applicant believes that they have been retaliated against for disclosing information regarding misconduct under the Code, they should file a written complaint with any Contentstack manager, any Senior Leader, or the People Team. It is Contentstack’s policy to encourage worksite employees to come forward with any safety, ethical, or legal concerns. Retaliation against those who bring forward these types of related concerns or complaints will not be tolerated.\nDrug-Free Workplace \nWe all have the responsibility to maintain a safe and efficient working environment. As such, these guidelines apply to all employees.\t\t\t\t\nEmployees who work while impaired by drugs or alcohol present a safety hazard to themselves and coworkers and prevent us from providing the best customer experience and producing award-winning products. \nAs a responsible member of our tribe, you should report to work fit to perform the duties of your job unencumbered by the negative effects of illegal drugs and alcohol. Any employee who engages in the following conduct may be subject to disc\nUse, possession, sale, or solicitation of illegal drugs while on duty, on Contentstack premises, or Contentstack time\nUnauthorized use or possession of alcohol while on duty, on Contentstack premises, or on Contentstack time\nReporting to or working while impaired by illegal drugs\nThe legal use of prescribed drugs or over-the-counter medications that do not impair an employee’s ability to perform essential job functions effectively and do not endanger the employee or other individuals in the workplace is permitted on the job. The misuse and/or abuse of prescription medications and/or over-the-counter medications is strictly prohibited.\nWe encourage employees with alcohol or drug dependencies to take advantage of our free and confidential Employee Welness Assistance Program (EWAP). An employee with a drug or alcohol problem may request approval to take unpaid time off to participate in a rehabilitation program. The time off will be granted if the absence will not impose an undue hardship on the Contentstack. However, the Contentstack may terminate the worksite employee’s employment without providing an opportunity to participate in a rehabilitation program if the worksite employee’s current use of alcohol or drugs prohibits the employee from performing their duties or endangers their health or safety or the health or safety of others.\nTo help ensure a safe, drug-free workplace, Contentstack has the right to inspect employees while on duty or on Contentstack property, including their persons, desks, and/or personal property, to the extent permitted by applicable law. We also have the right to investigate any possible violations of this policy. If anyone refuses to cooperate with an investigation of this nature (which may include medical testing for alcohol or drug use) the Contentstack may choose to discipline the employee. Withholding consent or failing to cooperate with any of these measures could subject the worksite employee to disciplinary procedures, up to and including termination of employment\nIf an employee is convicted of a drug-related charge that occurred in the workplace, Contentstack must be notified within five days. After receiving notice of such a conviction, the Contentstack will take appropriate action, which could include disciplinary action, including termination of employment.\n\nModern Slavery Act (Global Policy)\nContentstack is committed to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and social responsibility. This Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy underscores Contentstack\u0027s dedication to creating a business environment that values human rights, ethical practices, and social responsibility. Through our collaborative efforts, we aspire to contribute to a world where every individual\u0027s freedom and dignity are safeguarded.
"Our Commitment\nContentstack takes a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking. We are dedicated to preventing these offenses in our own operations and working diligently to influence our partners and suppliers to uphold the same standards. We recognize that our responsibility extends beyond our immediate activities and impacts the global community.\nDue Diligence and Risk Assessment\nWe undertake rigorous due diligence to identify and address potential risks related to modern slavery and human trafficking. This includes assessing our supply chain to identify high-risk areas and partners, collaborating with industry experts to stay informed about evolving risks, and conducting regular audits to evaluate compliance with anti-slavery and anti-trafficking standards. Contentstack is committed to partnering with suppliers who share our values and adhere to high ethical standards.\nTraining and Awareness\nWe provide training to all employees to recognize and respond to signs of modern slavery and human trafficking. This empowers individuals to be vigilant and report concerns promptly. We maintain a confidential and accessible reporting hotline that allows individuals to report suspicions or concerns related to modern slavery and human trafficking. Reports can be made anonymously, and we commit to thoroughly investigating all reports. Contentstack is dedicated to protecting individuals who report concerns in good faith, and ensures that whistleblowers are shielded from any form of retaliation.\nWe acknowledge that our efforts to combat modern slavery and human trafficking must be dynamic and adaptable. We are committed to continually evaluating and refining our policies, procedures, and practices to ensure their effectiveness. Contentstack’s Board of Directors takes an active role in overseeing our modern slavery and human trafficking initiatives. They provide guidance, evaluate progress, and ensure that our commitment remains unwavering.\nDiversity, Equality, and Inclusion\nAt Contentstack, we understand that a diverse workforce, in representation, background, and thought, creates an environment where curiosity, innovation, and excellence can flourish. \nWe are an equal-opportunity employer and continually strive to grow with a richness of diversity that reflects our customers and the communities in which we live and serve. We know that our products, customer service, and commitment to quality are better served and provide us with the edge we need to be the industry leader in headless content management with this diversity.\nContentstack is committed to ensuring that work allows each employee to grow professionally and that we will maintain an environment that provides for equity in career development and promotion opportunities.\nWe embrace the complexity of our Contentstack tribe and actively work to ensure that each employee feels included and comfortable bringing their authentic self to work. These unique perspectives help shape how we create our products, do business, and develop our Contentstack culture.\n\nPersonal Relationships Guidelines\nContentstack is a family-friendly, inclusive workplace committed to maintaining a positive, respectful, comfortable, and safe work environment. The purpose of this guideline is to provide guidance around familial and romantic relationships at Contentstack. And don’t worry, your rights as an employee and other applicable federal, state, or local laws concerning the employment relationship still apply - we’re awesome like that.\nLet’s start with the easy stuff. At Contentstack, we like to treat each other like family, but in case an actual “family member” wants to work here, (spouse, domestic partner, daughter, son, parent, sister, brother, grandparent, or grandchild, including close relatives such as aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, relatives by marriage, and adoptive relationships) please notify the People team so we can make sure there is no conflict of interest. Also, this needs to happen before they go through the interview process. No surprises, please.
"Now let’s roll up our sleeves and talk about intimate or romantic relationships at work. Hey, it happens, we get it and we want to be cool about it - mostly, but we need to make sure those relationships aren’t (1) causing an unfair, inequitable, or harassing workplace or environment (2) creating the appearance of #1, and (3) putting you, the other party, or the Contentstack’s professional reputation or how we do business at risk. If you are involved or plan to become involved in an intimate or romantic relationship with another employee, a vendor, a contractor, a customer, or any other individual in which the relationship could possibly raise the appearance of favoritism, bias, or concerns of conflict of interest, please reach out to the People Team. They will handle it as delicately and confidentially as possible and advise you on the next steps.\nIf employees, whether or not involved in relationships, believe they have been, or are being negatively affected by either of the relationships mentioned above, reach out to the People team. Additionally, if relationships develop into a situation that may be viewed as harassment or discrimination, employees should refer to the Sexual Harassment Policy applicable to India.\n\nSexual Harassment Policy (India)\nObjective\nContentstack is committed to providing and maintaining a workplace that is free of harassment of any kind. We prohibit any conduct that contributes to an intimidating work environment and/or interferes with a person’s ability to perform his or her job. Contentstack policy against harassment also covers interactions between employees in person, by telephone, through electronic communications, at the workplace, and off-site activities sponsored by the Contentstack such as business meetings, training sessions, and work-related travel.

Supervisors and senior management should know everything that annoys employees or hinders their work, so they can resolve it as quickly as possible. Employees should be able to follow a fair grievance procedure to be heard and avoid conflicts.\nThe Contentstack encourages employees to communicate their grievances. That way we can foster a supportive and pleasant workplace for everyone.\nThis policy refers to everyone in the Contentstack regardless of position or status.\nGrievance definition\nWe define grievance as any complaint, problem, or concern of an employee regarding their workplace, job, or coworker relationships.\nEmployees can file grievances for any of the following reasons:\nWorkplace harassment\nHealth and Safety\nSupervisor behavior\nAdverse changes in employment conditions\nThis list is not exhaustive. However, employees should try to resolve less important issues informally before they resort to a formal grievance.\nEmployees who file grievances can:\nReach out to their direct supervisor or People Team\nFile a grievance form explaining the situation in detail via email to the People team\nRefuse to attend formal meetings on their own\nAppeal on any formal decision\nEmployees who face allegations have the right to:\nReceive a copy of the allegations against them\nRespond to the allegations\nAppeal on any formal decision\nThe Contentstack is obliged to:\nHave a formal grievance procedure in place\nCommunicate the procedure\nInvestigate all grievances promptly\nTreat all employees who file grievances equally\nPreserve confidentiality at any stage of the process\nResolve all grievances when possible\nRespect its no-retaliation policy when employees file grievances with the Contentstack or external agencies (e.g. Equal Employment Opportunity Committee)\nProcedures\nEmployees are encouraged to talk to each other to resolve their problems. When this isn’t possible, employees should know how to file a grievance:\nCommunicate informally with their direct supervisor. The supervisor will try to resolve the problem. When employees want to complain about their supervisor, they should first try to discuss the matter and resolve it between them. In that case, they’re advised to request an informal meeting. Supervisors should try to resolve any grievance as quickly as possible. When they’re unable to do so, they should refer to the People Team and cooperate with all other procedures.\nIf the grievance relates to a supervisor\u0027s behavior that can bring disciplinary action (e.g. sexual harassment or violence), employees should refer directly to the People Team or the next-level supervisor.\nAccommodate the procedure outlined below\nThe People Team (or any appropriate person in the absence of the People Team) should follow the procedure below:\nAsk the employee to fill out a grievance form\nTalk with the employee to ensure the matter is understood completely\nProvide the employee who faces allegations with a copy of the grievance\nOrganize mediation procedures (e.g. arranging a formal meeting)\nInvestigate the matter or ask the help of an investigator when needed\nKeep employees informed throughout the process\nCommunicate the formal decision to all employees involved
"Take action to ensure the formal decision is adhered to\nDeal with appeals by gathering more information and investigating further\nKeep accurate records\nThis procedure may vary according to the nature of a grievance.

It is typically used when an employee is failing to meet job expectations. H``owever, if implemented correctly, it can be a positive tool to align management and employees, improving job performance as well as job satisfaction.\nTo enhance an employee\u0027s performance under the supervision of the immediate manager \nThis Policy is applicable to all Contentstack permanent and employees on probation \nPolicy / Process\nThe purpose of the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is to help managers and direct reportees address and resolve performance issues. This guidance should be used in concert with the advice received from the  People Team. The PIP communicates the performance discrepancies when an improved level of performance is to be achieved and the action steps that will assist the employee in meeting performance expectations.\nIf an employee is unable to meet performance standards during the time period with Contentstack he /she will go through the performance improvement plan \nReporting manager, People Team, and the underperforming employee are involved in the Plan.\nDuration of PIP\nOn receiving the PIP, the employee has a specified time, generally from one to three months, to meet the objectives.
"Reporting manager will prepare a proper action plan and track the performance on weekly bases \nReporting manager will give weekly feedback to the employee who is under the PIP assessment and document the same \nIf employee performance is not consistent even after the PIP or during the assessment, the Contentstack reserves the right to separate them from employment \nAll performance-related separations will be monitored and documented by the People Team on a case-to-case basis. In this case, serving of notice period is reporting manager\u0027s discretion\nPIP only covers performance issues.\nProcess to initiate PIP\nReporting manager identifies the case of underperformance and immediately provides feedback on areas of improvement. This is documented on the same date by the reporting manager and share with the employee.\nIf the performance of the employed does not meet the set expectations the reporting manager informs the People Team and makes a PIP \nThe reporting manager shares the PIP with the employee in the presence of the People Team and the same is recorded over email \nThe employee performance is tracked and a daily/weekly review is done by the reporting manager. The same is documented and shared with the employee.\nAt final review, if the employee does not meet the targets set in the PIP, the separation process is initiated by the people team with the final approval of the functional head \nIf the employee successfully completes the PIP he /she is inducted back and the employee should be notified and removed from the PIP plan.\n\nIndia Employee Exit Policy\nThis policy has been tailored to cater to all departures from Contentstack. Employee exits are majorly divided into 2 sections:\nVoluntary\nInvoluntary\nVoluntary\nYou have willingly decided to leave Contentstack due to various possible factors. The best way to do that is:\nFormal Resignation\nFormal Resignation - Employee has decided to move on and hence here is the resignation process for the same.\nEmployee needs to send an email to the Reporting Manager for submitting a resignation,  marking “CC” to peopleops_india@contentstack.com\nWeek 1:\nReporting Manager has a discussion with the employee (if already not done before the resignation email was  sent).\nPeople Team will meet the employee to understand the situation. We will ensure the confidentiality of the discussion as needed. In the event, the employee mentions any concerns, with the reporting manager, this will be addressed through proper channels.\nReporting Manager submits summary of his/her meeting\nBelow are the possible outcomes of the meeting:\nResignation is accepted: \nWe will send an email to the employee, with the reporting manager in “CC”. The email would consist details of\nResignation date\nAcceptance of Resignation mail\nLast working Date\nThe next steps\nPeople Ops team will intimate the Accounts, IT and Administration team on the last working day. This will ensure all necessary processes are completed in a timely manner.\nWe will ask employee to share their overall experience with us through the Employee Exit Survey form.\nWe will complete below exit formalities on the last working day:\t\nMeet with the People Team to explain the exit formalities and clarity on all benefits, full and final settlement, etc. \nExit form shared with the  concerned team for all termination processes.\nAdministration team will reach out to the employee regarding the submission of assets.\nNon Compete and Non Disclosure Agreement sign off.\nWe will also complete below formalities post the last working day:\nOnce all processes are completed, we will issue the Experience Certificate.\nStatutory obligations will be processed as per labor guidelines.\nEmployee’s full and final settlement will be done within 45 calendar days from the Experience Certificate letter date and the Relieving letter is issued post the settlement.\nWe would love to have the employee stay with us: In this case we will have follow up discussions until a decision is made. If the employee decides to continue with us, they will follow up the resignation email with a resignation withdrawal email.
"Exceptions - \nEmployee Resigns / willing to serve notice period / but not physically present: Business Head’s advice. Decision to be endorsed by the People Team.\nAbsent from work (unapproved leave), resigns and not willing to serve any notice period: Will be considered as Absconding, unless for Medical reasons.\nEmployee resigns / cannot serve notice period due to medical reasons: Notice can be waived off only if the claim is substantiated by proper Medical documents like discharge summary etc., a doctor’s note will not do.                                                                      \nIn any of these cases or any other exceptional situation, People team and Leadership Team will have the final say based on the situation. When in doubt please consult with us before initiating a decision or responding to anyone in writing.\t\nUnfortunately, within the Voluntary employee exit, we have an unforeseen exit:\nAbsconding\nAbsconding- In this case, the employee is absent from work without providing any prior intimation to the reporting manager and approval for the absence. If the duration of such absence is 3 (three) consecutive business days, we will consider the employee as absconding.\nEmployee may abscond under below situations:\nSituation 1 - An active employee (Employee has not resigned) is on unauthorized absence.\nSituation 2 - An employee who resigns but does not serve his/her notice period and is absent without providing any prior intimation to the reporting manager.\nHere are the guidelines for the same:\nReporting manager needs to email People Team if an employee has not reported to work under any of the above two situations for 2 consecutive business days. Please add below details in the email:\nEmployee Name\nDate since when employee not reporting to work\nPrimary contact number where employee has been contacted\nResponse received when contacted\nPeople Team will try reaching out to the employee within the next business day.\nPeople Team will share the Show Cause Letter through email and mail to the employee which will mention a timeframe of 5 calendar days within which the employee should report to work.\nIn case the employee reports to work within the stipulated time-frame: \nSituation 1 - Reporting manager and People Team talk to the employee together and a decision is made accordingly.  The employee can resume work only once there is an email approval from the People Team. Any employee joining back without following the process is considered as Terminated and inactive as per People records.\nSituation 2 - Employee needs to serve a complete notice period or pay in lieu of notice, as decided by the People Team.\nIn case the employee doesn’t come back: The salary for the month is put on hold and accordingly adjusted against the notice period as per agreement guidelines and the employee is marked “absconded and terminated” in our records.\nIf considered as “Absconded and terminated”, a Termination letter is issued through email and mail and concerned teams are informed.\nPlease bear in mind that once the termination is issued it cannot be revoked and any rejoining will require the approval of the People Team. The employees will not be entitled for any relieving documents or experience letters. Exceptions can be considered only in case an employee absconds due to medical or any other genuine reason if accepted by the People Team.\nInvoluntary\nUnfortunately, there may be situations, where a tribe member will have to be relieved from Contentstack due to various factors. We always opt for the best way, that is:\nRequested Resignation\nRequested Resignation - You are requested to resign and exit formalities are completed as per process. You are also provided a relieving and experience certificate. Below are the situations for this form of exit.\nPerformance: When an individual has been observed to have persistent performance concerns, we do our best to ensure work on it together. The Reporting Manager will notify the same with specifics through verbal and written communication. If the concern persists, we move to a more target oriented process, a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). During this period, the individual is provided with clear targets for a specific duration and expected to achieve the same through guidance and regular feedback. We are determined and positive that our hardworking and dedicated tribe members will surely achieve the targets and be out of PIP. However, if the expected performance is still not achieved, then we need to move ahead with the separation meeting due to performance.
Absenteeism: When an individual has been observed to have a frequent and extended absence from work (more than 3 business days) without prior notice or at short notice, where the reporting manager does not have the option to reconsider the request and approve accordingly. Reporting manager may approve these leaves based on the situation but haven’t planned for this in terms of business requirement. This is considered as ‘Approved but not Pre-approved Leaves\u0027. This classification of leaves will not be applicable in case of medical exigencies which are substantiated with proper proof.\nIf observed, the reporting manager should confront this with the individual verbally, followed by written communication. In case of recurrence, this will need People Team intervention and an official warning. The individual needs to accept this warning while agreeing not to repeat this in the future.\nIf such Absenteeism continues, Reporting Manager and People Team can decide if the final step needs to be taken and accordingly the separation meeting is organized.\nMedical Absence: In case of medical exigencies, you need to produce proper documentation to substantiate the absence. Decisions are made based on the situation. Once approved, it is considered as per the Leave Policy. If either party decides that work cannot be continued for long, the separation decision is made in consultation with the People Team on a case to case basis.\nOther Cases: An employee may also be requested to resign due to other unavoidable circumstances such as role redundant, change in Business plan, business restructuring, etc. In this case, the separation meeting to be planned accordingly:\nThe Separation Meeting for the above Involuntary Exits\nThe employee, Reporting Manager and People Team are present for this meeting. The second level manager may be present for the meeting depending on the requirement.\nWe should always ensure that we have provided the best possible clarity on the situation. The decision undertaken is final and cannot be reversed.\nWe understand that this is difficult for the tribe member and hence our best possible option is always Requested Resignation. Notice period will be as decided by the People Team based upon Employment Agreement clauses. The individual may also be asked not to report to work during the notice period.\nFor Requested Resignation, the individual needs to send the resignation email to the reporting manager and the people team immediately.\nTermination process is initiated only if the individual is unwilling to go through Requested Resignation. Termination debars the employee from claiming any benefits plus renders a poor reference check during any further employment verification.\nAs part of Involuntary employee exit, there may be situations where Requested Resignation is not undertaken and we need to follow the other alternative:\nTermination\nTermination - The last and unfortunate exit is through Termination. In this case, Contentstack terminates employee’s service with the organization. Termination letter is issued instead of an Experience and Relieving letter. Termination debars the employee from claiming any benefits plus renders a poor reference check during any further employment verification. Contentstack reserves the right to take such action, if need be. This step is mainly taken in below situations:\nMisconduct and Violation of Contentstack policy: When an individual has violated Code of Conduct, Contentstack Ethics, workplace health and safety obligations or any such act that may be construed as breach, we will have to decide and this may lead to immediate termination.\nThe Separation Meeting\nThe employee, Reporting Manager and People Team are present for this meeting. The second level manager may need to be present for the meeting depending on the requirement.\nThe invite for the meeting can be sent as and when needed prior the meeting time. It does not have any minimum duration.\nWe should always ensure that we have provided the best possible clarity on the situation with clear evidence. The decision undertaken is final and cannot be reversed.
Termination letter will be issued to the employee through email and letter, during the meeting itself.\nOther situations: Termination can also be decided on other cases such as Absentia leading or Absconding and situations where Requested Resignation is not accepted by the employee.\nIn any of the above cases, the People Team plays the role of an Arbitrator in the event of a conflict. Also note that you can register your grievance with the People Team, if they feel that the separation is not handled properly. Any such grievance will be taken in writing, discussed and resolved as appropriate.\nNote\nAll documents \u0026 Contentstack assets need to be returned and cleared as per Contentstack guidelines, for any exit.\nYou are expected to honor our Confidentiality Agreement even after exit as signed and agreed by you.\nNotice period days are defined as per the Contentstack policies shared from time to time.\nFull and Final Settlement Process\nIt is our responsibility to ensure all formalities are completed in a timely manner, including the full and final settlement (F\u0026F). \nSalary Payout Cycle - You salary is process as per the below cycles:\nIn case your last working date is on or before 20th of the next month, your current month salary is put on hold and complete payment is released along with your full and final settlement. Any exception is approved by People Team.\nIn case your last working date is within 10th to 15th of the next month, your current month salary is released as per the regular cycle.\nEmployee’s full and final settlement will be done in a timely manner.\nRelieving letter is issued post the settlement.\nBelow are the steps for processing full and final settlement:\nF\u0026F details are sent to the ex-employee by People Team, prior to processing the same.\nFor any discrepancies, the ex-employee needs to revert within one (1) business day.\nPeople Team confirms the details with Accounts.\nF\u0026F is released to the ex-employee by Accounts. \nIn case your last working date is on or before 14th of the current month, your full and final settlement will be processed by the 30th of the current month.\nIn case your last working date is after 14th of the current month, your full and final settlement will be processed by the 30th of the next month.\nYou need to ensure that all documents are submitted from your end as needed within the timelines mentioned by the People Team to ensure your full and final is processed in time.\nPeople Team will email the relieving letter, Final Payslip and Tax computation with you within five (5) calendar days from the F\u0026F release date.\n\nRecruitment Policy - India\nObjective:\nThe success of Contentstack relies on its ability to attract, retain and develop its talent. The Talent Acquisition and Hiring Procedures - India has been established to ensure Contentstack has the opportunity to attract the best available staff for all vacant positions and standardize the hiring mechanism across all units in India. We provide equal employment opportunities to all applicants irrespective of race, gender, marital status, religion, nationality, physical disability or age. Hiring decisions are purely based on an individual’s capability, qualification, and experience.\nScope:\nThis policy applies to all employees involved in the recruitment and hiring process for Contentstack India and it refers to all potential job candidates. This policy covers the following categories of hires:\nAn Employee:\nAn employee is a probationary or a confirmed employee, employed in a full or a part time capacity. Full time employees will be on a six month probationary period, at the end of which, their reporting manager should advise the Talent Acquisition Team and PeopleOps as to whether the appointment should be confirmed, extended or terminated.\nContractors:\nResources hired through another agency for a fixed term and work are considered contractors. The fixed term will cease on the expiry of the term period thereof, in absence of written renewal of the period of the contract. Contractors are not eligible to participate in Contentstack Salary \u0026 Bonus Programs and other benefit programs announced from time to time by the Contentstack.
Interns:\nInterns are classified as students currently pursuing their course and are provided an opportunity to work on short-term projects as part of their curriculum, simultaneously fulfilling a business need and gaining valuable work experience.\nForeign Nationals:\nAll foreign nationals in full time, Contract and Intern positions being hired must have a valid work visa. It is the candidate\u0027s responsibility to obtain and maintain a valid work visa throughout their employment. Any exceptions to this must be approved by the People Team prior to the interview process.\nRehire:\nEx-employees being rehired will be governed by rehire guidelines and approvals. These guidelines are applicable for all candidates who were previously employed under any type of employment (Contract or Full-time). A referral Bonus is not applicable for this category of hire. Rehires must be approved by the PeopleOps team before any interviews can be initiated. \nHiring Criteria:\nThe following criteria is applicable to all types of employment across all business units in India: \nMinimum Age of Employment:\nAny prospective hire who is less than Eighteen (18) years of age is not eligible for employment.\nEmployment of Family Members:\nFamily members can be employed at Contentstack, however, one family member may not have direct influence over the other’s conditions of employment (i.e. salary, grade, performance rating). The People Team must be informed during the interview process if a family member of a current employee is being considered. For the purpose of this policy, family members may be defined as spouse, children, parent, siblings or someone in a close personal relationship.\nResume Validity:\nResumes remain valid only for a span of three (3) months from the date of receiving the resume. In case of employee referrals upon expiry of three (3) months, the referrer can re-refer if the position is still available.\nRejected Candidates:\nCandidates who do not get through the recruitment process or are rejected at any stage of recruitment past the Recruiter Screen can re-apply after three (3) months of the last TA process.\nTalent Acquisition Process:\nThese steps should be completed in order. Deviating from the process will cause unnecessary complications and can jeopardize equity across the process for all candidates.\nRequisition:\nThe hiring process starts with initiating a Job Requisition Request in the Google Form which goes through an approval process defined globally. All positions whether Full-time, Contractor or Intern require approval before the start of the recruitment process. \nThe process works as mentioned below:\nSubmission: The respective Hiring Managers (not Team Leads) submit new or replacement hire requisition requests through the designated Google Form.\nProcessing: Once the TA team receives your request, we will promptly initiate the requisition in Greenhouse and forward it to the Compensation Committee for approval.\nNotification: Upon approval, the hiring manager will receive an automatic notification from Greenhouse, keeping you informed throughout the process.\nOnly respective Managers of the teams will be able to submit requisition requests. To access the new hire requisition submission form, please follow this link: Requesting a New/Replacement Hire \u0026 Hiring Manager Guide \nRecruiting:\nRecruiting of any resource is coordinated through the Talent Acquisition (TA) team. Open positions are shared with employees for Employee Referrals. No candidates will be offered a position unless they have completed the full TA recruitment process from start to finish\nTesting:\nAll technical positions from Level 1 to Level 5 will have a technical test. The technical test/live coding is designed to be completed in one hour. Certain roles may require the candidate to spend more time but not extend beyond two hours. It is imperative that we stay competitive while at the same time ensuring a good candidate experience. \nInterviews:\nA candidate may have 2 - 3 levels of interviews depending on the position \u0026 nature of employment. Interviews should either be conducted by a Lead and above grade employee or the interviewer should be at least one level above the grade being hired. If someone has provided a referral for a position they can in no way be involved in the interview process so as to not influence the hiring decision. Interviews are required to have a female on the panel in order to get diverse perspectives and help meet our DEI\u0026B goals. Interviews will abide by the following path:
Recruiter Screen\nHiring Manager Review of Resume\nHiring Manager Interview\nTechnical Interview\nTest (if applicable)\nFinal People Team Interview\nOffer made by the People Team\nFeedback:\nInterview comments must be duly filled in the scorecard in Greenhouse and shared with the TA team at all interview levels. Interview results are kept in our records as well as communicated to a candidate whether the candidate is selected or rejected at any level of interview. This is required to make sure the process remains equitable.\nOffer:\nThe TA team shall be responsible for reviewing and confirming that the offer details are within People team guidelines and meet the business strategy. Offer recommendations and approvals will be handled by the TA Manager. The employment offer should be signed within three business days of receiving the offer and will be executed via Docusign. The terms and conditions of the offer letter shall be final and binding. No one is authorized to make an offer of employment to a candidate except a member of the TA team unless otherwise agreed to prior to an offer being made.\nNon-Acceptance:\nIn case of non-acceptance of the offer within the stipulated time or the Contentstack finds the information provided by the candidate to be false or misleading, it reserves the right to revoke the offer which will be communicated in writing to the candidate and the Hiring Manager. This extends into the Background Check. Should the Background Check result provide concerning information, the role will be re-opened immediately and new candidates moved through the process ASAP.\nEmployee Onboarding Process India\nWelcome to the Tribe!

It encourages people to invest in a pension account regularly while they work. When they retire, they can withdraw a portion of the money saved, and the rest will be given as a monthly pension.\nThe scheme encourages people to invest in a pension account at regular intervals during the course of their employment. After retirement, the subscribers can take out a certain percentage of the corpus. As an NPS account holder, you will receive the remaining amount as a monthly pension post your retirement.\n\nNATIONAL PENSION SCHEME BENEFITS | \nNPS offers a range of investment options and choice of Pension Funds (PFs) for planning the growth of the investments in a reasonable manner and monitor the growth of the pension corpus\nNATIONAL PENSION SCHEME BENEFITS |\nEmployee tax benefits for self-contribution:\nEmployees who contribute to NPS are eligible for the following tax breaks on their contributions:\nTax deduction of up to 10% of pay (Basic + DA) under Section 80 CCD(1), subject to a maximum of Rs.1.50 lakh under Section 80CCE.\nA tax deduction of up to Rs. 50,000 under Section 80 CCD(1B) in addition to the overall limit of Rs.1.50 lakh under Section 80CCE.\nEmployee tax benefits on employer contributions:\nEligible for a tax deduction of up to 10% of salary (Basic + DA) (14% if such contribution is made by the Central Government) supplied by the employer under Section 80 CCD(2) beyond the Rs.1.50 lakh limit provided by Section 80CCE.\nUnder the NPS, employers can contribute to their employees\u0027 NPS accounts.

However, it\u0027s important to note that employer contributions to NPS accounts are included in the employee\u0027s taxable income and are subject to tax deduction limits.\nEmployee tax benefits on employer contributions will be part of your existing annual CTC.\nTax Deduction under Section 80CCD(2): Employees can claim a tax deduction for the employer\u0027s contribution to their NPS account under Section 80CCD(2) of the Income Tax Act. This deduction is available over and above the deduction available under Section 80C.\nThe maximum deduction allowed under Section 80CCD(2) is 10% of the employee\u0027s salary (basic salary + dearness allowance) or the gross total income, whichever is lower.

It\u0027s important to note that these tax benefits and deduction limits are based on the current tax laws and regulations in India as of our knowledge cutoff in September 2021.
