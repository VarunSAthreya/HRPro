## Summary of Research Papers

Below are brief summaries for each paper implemented in the Project:

---

### 1. Adaptive-RAG: Learning to Adapt Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models through Question Complexity
**Link:** [arXiv:2403.14403](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403)
- **Adaptive Strategy:** Proposes a framework that dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy based on the complexity of the userâ€™s question.
- **Complexity Classifier:** Uses a lightweight classifier trained on automatically obtained labels to predict query complexity.
- **Flexible Retrieval:** Seamlessly adapts between no-retrieval, single-step retrieval, and iterative retrieval methods, thereby balancing efficiency and accuracy in QA systems.

---

### 2. Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation
**Link:** [arXiv:2401.15884](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15884)
- **Robust Generation:** Addresses hallucinations in large language models by assessing the relevance of retrieved documents before generation.
- **Retrieval Evaluator:** Introduces a lightweight evaluator that returns a confidence score, triggering alternative retrieval actions when needed.
- **Web Search Augmentation:** Extends static corpora retrieval with large-scale web searches and uses a decompose-then-recompose algorithm to focus on key information, thereby enhancing output robustness.

---

### 3. Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection
**Link:** [arXiv:2310.11511](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)
- **Self-Reflection Mechanism:** Introduces reflection tokens that allow the model to critique and adjust its own outputs during generation.
- **Adaptive Retrieval:** The model learns to retrieve passages on-demand and uses its self-generated critiques to refine answers, improving factuality.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Demonstrates significant gains over traditional RAG approaches on tasks such as open-domain QA, reasoning, and fact verification.

---

### 4. ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models
**Link:** [arXiv:2210.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)
- **Interleaved Reasoning and Acting:** Proposes a framework where the model alternates between generating reasoning traces and executing actions.
- **Tool Integration:** Leverages external tools (e.g., a Wikipedia API) to fetch information on demand, reducing hallucinations and enhancing task performance.
- **Improved Interpretability:** The interleaved process not only leads to better task outcomes but also makes the decision-making process more transparent to users.

### 5. The Landscape of Emerging AI Agent Architectures for Reasoning, Planning, and Tool Calling: A Survey
**Link:** [arXiv:2404.11584](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11584)
- **Comprehensive Survey:** Reviews recent advancements in AI agent architectures, focusing on how they enable complex tasks through enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution.
- **Single vs. Multi-Agent Systems:** Discusses both single-agent and multi-agent designs, highlighting trade-offs in terms of division of labor, leadership structures, and communication strategies.
- **Key Themes:** Outlines essential components such as agent personas, effective tool calling, dynamic team construction, and the integration of planning and self-reflection to robustly accomplish end-to-end tasks.
